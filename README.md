# CNO-SKB-Work
Repository for all my SKB work.

** Linked List Lab **
Key Takeaways:
- Explicit memory management- outside of the heap, even managing the stack, making sure to keep ordering of code in mind
- Little bit of algorithms part - meeting time constraint and reversing a linkedlist in C, using two different pointers to make the swaps happen
- Making code a bit more robust with error handling for things such as NULL pointers

** Data Lab **
Key Takeaways:
- Playing around with bit level representation of ints and floats (numbers)
- Did most of this by hand to visualize it
- ! ~ & ^ | + << >> 
- Mathematical operations can be done by some of these operations, such as multiplying and diving by power by shifting
- MSB and LSB (for endianness)
- Skipped Floating Point, will re-visit

** Bomb Lab **
Key Takeaways:
- Setting breakpoints so damn bomb wouldn't explode and also to debug
- Inspecting registers and memory states using i r, x/d, etc
- Got decent with debugging using GDB (command line debugger tool)
- Understanding GDB - $ (constants), %registers, (%rbx) or 0x1c(%rax) for dereferencing or addressing mode
- Used commands such as r, disass, si, ni strings and objdump to view functions and strings used in code
- When observing the disassembled code, got familiar with what to look for, almost like a puzzle
- Mostly looked at the compare and jump statements prior to a call to explode bomb to see how to bypass the call of that function
- Getting familiar with x64 assembly overall, such as operand order, jump instructions

** Attack Lab **
Key Takeaways:
- Explicit memory management- outside of the heap, even managing the stack, making sure to keep ordering of code in mind
