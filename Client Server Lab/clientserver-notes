client sends request -> 
server process and handles request ->
server sends response

NIC lives and utilies I/O bus

socket programming basics:
client ip:client port (ephemeral / random assinged by kernel)
<-> server ip:server port (port service ex: web server port 80)
kernel on the server dictates what service to call

each port has a process / program to utilize for client request

all unix i/o devices including networks are modeled as files

file descriptor - these files are always present whenever a program is run
stdin, stdout, stderr (0, 1, 2)
